/**
Challenge:

- Send a request to add a new todo item
    - BaseURL: https://apis.scrimba.com/jsonplaceholder/
    - Endpoint: /todos
- Body object should contain a "title" property (string) 
  and a "completed" property (boolean)
- Don't add the .then() blocks yet - we have 1 more thing 
  to do before it'll work correctly

Part 2 - add the .then blocks to check the data coming back
